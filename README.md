# Durham-Python-Project
This is my python programming project for Durham University which I coded in first term of this year (2025). The project consists of three questions, each on one of the major topics covered in the module Programming for Data Science. The first question is centered on web scrapping. The second question is based on text analysis and data representation. The third question is on creating a Bayesian network. 

Please note that this code was run on Durham University's supercomputer which already contained the files needed for question 2. Information on how to access these files is included in the heading of question 2. The drone.csv file used for question 3 was made available to students through the university's private sharepoint. I have tried to find a public link to it but so far have been unable. 

All the graphs referenced in the code are available in the durham_python_project_graphs zip file
